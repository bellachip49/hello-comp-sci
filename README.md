"Hello World!"
This is one of the many too-lazy-to-count repos I have.
Maybe let's rollback to one of the first messages I typed in my first ever README I made when I was still a tiny pint-sized 4th grader:
"The cake is a lie."
Maybe that's too unoriginal...maybe...
"Welcome to Bella's repo!!! :D"
Yep. Sounds like me from way back then.
